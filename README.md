# RobotsGame

## Welcome to our Game! 

This project is a continuation of two previous projects: 
1) https://github.com/HilaShoshan/ObjectOriented_Task2.git
2) https://github.com/shani-co/-OOP_Ex3.git

In this project we designed a game of robots.

All the data about the game, like robots ,fruits and the graph, have readed from the server as Json string.

There are two options to games: 
A Manual Game, and Automatic Game 
[Detailed explanations of how to operate are in our wiki]

The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible (by eating fruits - bananas and apples). 

There are stages with a single robot, with two, or three.
The number of fruits also varies in each of the 24 stages [0,23].

The main part of this assignment was to obtain a number of points as requested, no more calls to serve than requested.

At the end of each game you can see the number of points and moves we've made, and also choose whether to save the game as a KML file.
